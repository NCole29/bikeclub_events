description: '<em>Events</em> may be configured for paid registration, or as free events with optional registration. Events are listed on the Calendar, the Upcoming Events block on the home page (if enabled), and the main content section of the home page (if promoted to home page). Events remain visible on the home page until the event date has passed. Events may be public or limited to Members or Administrators.'
help: "Fill the \"Summary for home page\" to display the event in the main content section of the home page. \r\nNote that the \"Free event\" registration form can be reused across multiple events; results for each individual event are accessed via the Results tab on its respective event page. <p></p>"
