description: '<em>Events</em> can be used for both free and paid activities, and registration is optional. Events are displayed in three places: on the calendar, in the "Upcoming Events" block on the home page (if block is placed), and in the content section of the home page (if "Summary for home page" is filled). An event will appear on the home page until its scheduled date has passed. Events may be public or limited to Members or Administrators.'
help: '<em>Events</em> are listed on the calendar and displayed on the home page. The event is removed from the home page after the date of the event so scheduling is disabled. '
